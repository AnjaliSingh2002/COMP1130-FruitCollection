# COMP1130 FruitCollection
Fruit collection assignment for COMP1130 Fall 2021

# Part 1

# Objectives
* Learn about Classes and Objects and create an Instance
* Practice creating methods
* Practice using Git and GitHub to collaborate on projects

# Instructions

* Choose a fruit to create a class for. **First check the list of pull requests** to this repository to make sure nobody else has already picked the same fruit. Let's assume you picked apple. In this case you should create the class Apple.java and AppleDriver.java. Ofcourse your fruit will be a different one so name your classes according to this patten: Fruit.java and FruitDriver.java
* In your version of Fruit.java class implement the following:
  * A method called `toString()` that returns a statement such as this: "This is an apple created by Muhammed"
  * Do not implement a main method in your fruit class, that should be in the driver class
* Create the driver class with the name of your fruit. For example, if you picked Apple, your driver class should be called AppleDriver.java. In the driver class implement the following:
  * Create a main method
  * Create an instance of your fruit and print the result of it's `toString()` method
  
# Submission

* Fork this repository: https://github.com/arasbm/COMP1130-FruitCollection
* Clone your fork of the repository onto you computer (for example you can use GitHub Desktop for this)
* Add your java files to the repository folder and complete them. Make sure to pick a fruit that is not picked by anyone else yet! The fruit names will be first come first serve. So the first pull request that picks a particular fruit is the only one that makes it into the repository
* Make sure your Java files compile. Run and test your driver class
* Commit your changes which should include exactly 2 Java file and no folders
* Push your commits to your fork
* When your changes are complete, go to your fork on GitHub and from there create a Pull Request to send your addition to the main repository here that you
started with
* Submit a link to your pull request on Moodle to complete the submission process
